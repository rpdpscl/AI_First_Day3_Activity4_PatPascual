            "\n",
            "### Ingredients:\n",
            "- 2 large eggs\n",
            "- 1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk\n",
            "- 1/4 cup evaporated milk\n",
            "- 1/4 cup sugar (for caramel)\n",
            "\n",
            "### Instructions:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Make the Caramel**:\n",
            "   - In a small saucepan, heat the sugar over medium heat until it melts and turns golden brown. Avoid stirring; instead, gently swirl the pan to ensure the sugar melts evenly.\n",
            "   - Once it reaches the desired color, immediately pour it into a small baking dish or individual ramekins, tilting to coat the bottom evenly. Be careful, as the caramel will be very hot.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Prepare the Flan Mixture**:\n",
            "   - In a mixing bowl, whisk the eggs gently. \n",
            "   - Add the sweetened condensed milk and evaporated milk to the eggs and mix until well combined.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Combine and Pour**:\n",
            "   - Strain the egg mixture through a fine sieve to ensure a smooth texture.\n",
            "   - Pour the mixture over the caramel in the baking dish or ramekins.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Bake**:\n",
            "   - Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).\n",
            "   - Place the baking dish or ramekins in a larger pan filled with about an inch of water (this is the water bath).\n",
            "   - Bake for about 30–40 minutes, or until set. You can test doneness by inserting a knife; it should come out clean.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Cool and Serve**:\n",
            "   - Let it cool to room temperature, then refrigerate it for a few hours or until chilled.\n",
            "   - To serve, run a knife around the edges, invert onto a plate, and let the caramel sauce drizzle over the top.\n",

            "\n",
            "4. **Crackers or Cookies**: The slight saltiness and crunch of crackers or cookies can balance the smooth texture of the flan.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Ice Cream**: A scoop of vanilla or coconut ice cream can add a delightful creaminess to the dessert experience.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Whipped Cream**: A dollop of whipped cream can lighten up the dish and add extra creaminess.\n",
            "\n",
